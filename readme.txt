This is iBizProduct v3!!! Welcome...

At the heart of this library is the iBizAPIClient. From that single class you can easily call any of the API Functions that are 
avaialable to a Product.

This also includes all of the data contracts you will require and a number of utilities to make your life easier. Lastly there are 
some base models that should assist you in developing your database schema. Please note that there is no Marketplace support in
the iBizProduct.Common library for version 3.0.0.*.
